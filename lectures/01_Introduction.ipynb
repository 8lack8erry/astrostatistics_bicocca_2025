The current experiments are [LIGO](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/) and [Virgo](https://www.virgo-gw.eu/), soon to be joined in the future by the space-borne [LISA](https://lisa.nasa.gov/) detector. Some of you are going to have a full class on gravitational-wave astronomy! These instruments extract detailed information about GW-emitting systems from **signals buried deep, deep within noise**. The techniques required to do this are at the forefront of data-based inferece, relying heavily on **Bayesian techniques**. \n",
