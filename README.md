## [Useful concept map](ASTR8070__ConceptMap.pdf) by Steve Taylor


## Aims

The use of statistics is ubiquitous in astronomy and astrophysics. Modern advances are made possible by the application of increasingly sophisticated tools, often dubbed as "data mining", "machine learning", and "artificial intelligence". This class provides an introduction to (some of) these statistical techniques in a very practical fashion, pairing formal derivations to hands-on computational applications. Although examples will be taken almost exclusively from the realm of astronomy, this class is appropriate to all Physics students interested in machine learning.

## :exclamation: Important

Data mining and machine learning are computational subjects. One does not understand how to treat scientific data by reading equations on the blackboard: you will need to get your hands dirty (and this is the fun part!). 

To this end, students are required to come to classes with a computer or any device where you can code on (larger than a smartphone I would say...). Each class will pair theoretical explanations to hands-on exercises and demonstrations. These are the key content of the course, so I highly encourage you to engage with them as much a possible. 


## Textbook and Resources

The **main textbook** we will be using is:

_["Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy"](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691198309/statistics-data-mining-and-machine-learning-in-astronomy), Željko, Andrew, Jacob, and Gray. Princeton University Press, 2012._

It's a wonderful book that I keep on referring to in my research. The library has a few copies. What I really like about that book is that they provide the code behind each single figure: [astroml.org/book\_figures](https://www.astroml.org/book_figures/). The best way to approach these topics is to study the introduction on the book, then grab the code and try to play with it.  Make sure you get the updated edition of the book (that's the one with a black cover, not orange) because all the examples have been updated to python 3.   

There are many **other good resources** in astrostatistics, here is a partial list. Some of them are free.
